# API Reference
If there was a programatic API implemented in any language (i.e Rust) That reference should lay here.
The goal would be to have a documentation site, with said API references, a single SPEC (which currently
is the README.md) and a big collection of samples. Apart from those a good documentation site must have a
FAQ and a series of tutorials and guides.

**TL;DR:** a good doc site must have a SPEC, a usage reference, samples, tutorials and a FAQ.
