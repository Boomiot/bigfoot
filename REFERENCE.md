# API Reference
If there was a programatic API implemented in any language (i.e Rust) That reference should lay here.
The goal would be to have a documentation site, with said API references, a single SPEC (which currently
is the README.md) and a big collection of samples. Apart from those a good documentation site must have a
FAQ and a series of tutorials and guides.

**TL;DR:** a good doc site must have a SPEC, a usage reference, samples, tutorials and a FAQ.

## Some notes about the project structure
Ideally all samples can live in this repo, there is no reason yet to give them a new home. 
Also: they can be flat. They are all independent repos, their dependencies should live somewhere
else, and they should be as easy to copy and get started as a single command. This is 
[apparently done easierly with subversion](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/123/how-to-download-a-single-folder-of-a-github-repository)
